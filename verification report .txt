## 1. DUT Details

* **Design Under Test (DUT):** `seq1011_mealy_overlap.sv`
* **FSM Type:** Mealy (output depends on state + input)
* **Sequence Detected:** `1011`
* **Overlap:** Supported (e.g., `1011011` → detect at 4th & 7th bit)
* **Reset:** Active-high, synchronous
* **Clock:** Rising-edge triggered
* **Output:** `det` → pulses high for 1 cycle when pattern detected

## 2. FSM Specification

### States

* **S0:** No match
* **S1:** Last input = `1`
* **S2:** Last 2 inputs = `10`
* **S3:** Last 3 inputs = `101`

### Transitions

* S0: `1 → S1`, `0 → S0`
* S1: `0 → S2`, `1 → S1`
* S2: `0 → S0`, `1 → S3`
* S3: `0 → S2`, `1 → S1` with `det=1`

### Output Logic

* `det=1` iff `(state==S3 && din==1)`

## 3. Verification Environment

### Testbenches Used

1. **Directed TB (`tb_seq1011_directed.sv`)**

   * Covers edge cases, overlapping detections, noise, and reset behavior.
   * Uses assertions + sliding window scoreboard.

2. **Random TB (`tb_seq1011_random.sv`)**

   * Runs randomized sequences with biasing toward forming `1011`.
   * Includes functional coverage for:

     * Input bits distribution (0/1)
     * All 4-bit windows (0–15)
     * Detection events (`det=1`)
   * Assertions to check correctness and pulse width.

### Tools

* **Simulator:** Questa Intel Starter FPGA Edition 2024.3
* **Waveform Dump:** `.wlf` (native), `.vcd` (exported for GitHub)

## 4. Results

### Directed Tests

* ✅ `1011` → 1 detection
* ✅ `1011011` → 2 detections (overlap)
* ✅ `11011` → 1 detection (handles leading 1s)
* ✅ `001011` → 1 detection (handles leading zeros)
* ✅ `10111011` → 2 detections back-to-back
* ✅ Random negative case → no false detections

All directed cases passed (assertions did not fire).

### Random Tests (5000 cycles, seed=123)

* Coverage achieved:

  * Input bit toggle: 100%
  * All 16 windows: 100%
  * Detection cross-coverage: 100%
* No assertion failures observed.
* Multiple detection pulses observed as expected.

### Waveforms

Captured in `seq1011_directed.wlf` and `seq1011_random.vcd`.
Example:

* Input sequence: `1 0 1 1 0 1 1`
* FSM states: `S0 → S1 → S2 → S3 → detect → S1 → S2 → S3 → detect → S1`
* `det` pulses high exactly on the 4th and 7th bits.

## 5. Bugs / Fixes

* No functional bugs observed in FSM or TB after first run.
* Adjusted testbench to correctly handle **Mealy same-cycle detection** (Moore would require 1-cycle delay in checker).

---

## 6. Conclusion

* ✅ DUT behavior matches FSM specification.
* ✅ All edge cases and overlaps handled.
* ✅ Assertions and scoreboard confirm correctness.
* ✅ Coverage closure achieved (all bins hit).
* ✅ Waveforms captured for documentation.

**Final Status:** **PASSED — 1011 Sequence Detector FSM verified successfully.**
